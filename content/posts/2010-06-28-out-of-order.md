I am currently living in the city of Tampere in Finland. Last year I spent the Summer working in Switzerland and thoroughly enjoyed it. I figured I should do something similar again, so I ended up here in Finland.

I live in a student housing complex called Mikontalo. I took some pictures of my apartment when I arrived: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apg88/collections/72157624376845612/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/apg88/sets/72157624376874388/</a>
